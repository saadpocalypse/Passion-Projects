# Sliding Puzzle

## How the game works
* The game was made using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
* I randomly pick one of the folders and asssign the images as sources to the <img> divs I make.
* The third image in every folder is blank, it is the empty tile that can be switched around.
* Each tile has a coordinate.
* When a tile is clicked, the program checks if an adjacent tile has the third image as its source.
* If it does, the sources for the two <img> divs are switched.
