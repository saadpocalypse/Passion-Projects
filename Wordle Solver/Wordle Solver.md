# Wordle Solver

## How it works
I use a text file that contains all the words Wordle uses and thae file is filtered down with every guess made by the user. 

## How to use
1. Make a guess on Wordle.

2. As it is evident from the guess, the letters R, A, N and E are incorrect, so I put them in the program as incorrect letters.

3. Since C is partially correct, I input it along with the position it is incorrectly placed at.

We have now shortened the list of words from 12972 options down to 240, which is 1.85% of the original number of options.
