# Wordle Solver

## How it works
I use a text file that contains all the words Wordle uses and thae file is filtered down with every guess made by the user. 

## How to use
1. Make a guess on Wordle.

2. As it is evident from the guess, the letters R, A, N and E are incorrect, so I put them in the program as incorrect letters.
