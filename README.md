# Passion Projects

These are random projects I make when I'm bored.

## Spelling Game (made in Python)
This game is similar to Spelling Bee by Times New York, all credit goes to them, not me. <br>
You put in 6 surrounding letters and 1 central letter and make all the words you can think of which include the central letter. <br>
I am using a summarized American English dictionary for validating the words. <br>
At any point in the game, you can enter '!!' as input to end the game and see a list of all the words that could have been formed. <br>
Rest of the rules are explained once you run the code.

## Luhn Algorithm
Luhn Algorithm, named after its creator, Hans Peter Luhn, is an algorithm to determine the validity of a plethora of identification numbers. The one I made is specifically for credit/debit card numbers.

## Mad Libs
The program asks for various inputs from users such as adjectives, verbs, and names of body parts to incorporate them into a hard-coded string, creating what is known as a 'Mad Lib'.

## Creed Bratton Bot
This bot goes the the Dunder Mifflin subreddit for the show The Office (US version) and looks for comments that mention Creed Bratton, a character from the show. If the name is found, it replies to the comment with a quote from the character. There is a separate [repository](https://github.com/saadpocalypse/CreedBrattonBot) for this bot.
