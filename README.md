# Python Projects

These are random projects I make when I'm bored.

## Spelling Game (made in Python)
This game is similar to Spelling Bee by Times New York, all credit goes to them, not me. <br>
You put in 6 surrounding letters and 1 central letter and make all the words you can think of which include the central letter. <br>
I am using a summarized American English dictionary for validating the words. <br>
At any point in the game, you can enter '!!' as input to end the game and see a list of all the words that could have been formed. <br>
Rest of the rules are explained once you run the code.
